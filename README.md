# Weather App
This was a take home challenge where I was asked to build a very simple weather application by matching a comp provided. The user is able to see the weather for Dallas, TX on page load and user is able to quickly toggle between Fahrenheit and Celcius by clicking on the button. 

## Deployed Link
View the [deployed link](https://weather-sr.surge.sh/) here!

## API 
This application uses [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to fetch live data for the current weather and forecast. 

## Future Additions
- Ability to search multiple cities 
- Background that matches weather forecast
- More weather details if user clicks on a day in the forecast (i.e. min/max temperatures for the day)
